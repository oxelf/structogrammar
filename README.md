# structogrammar

## Download
You can download it [here](https://github.com/oxelf/structogrammar/releases)

## The Reason I built this
I didn't like the way the available structogram
editors looked like they're from windows95(They are in fact),
so I tried to build something more modern and cross platform compatible.

## Platform Support
| MacOS | Windows | Linux  | Web | Android                   | iOS                       |
|-------|--------|--------|----|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| ✅     | ✅      | ✅      | ✅      | ❌(possibly in the future) | ❌(possible in the future) |

## Roadmap
- [ ] Case statement
- [ ] Multilanguage
- [ ] Save structogram as json
- [ ] Import Structogram from json
- [ ] Add struct inside for the following blocks: function, if, forLoop, whileLoop, do while loop
- [ ] Resizing of blocks inside an if or case block.
- [ ] Import Structogram from cpp code

## Run locally
Requirements:
- Flutter installed. every version >= 3.0 should work, latest is recommended.
